Traffic management system:

Create a maps of junctions (nodes, must be directed and independent) with weighted edges based on distance/traffic.  Using a traversal algorithm (BFS probably), find the best route.

If the weights corresponds to the cars/unit area on that road, we can compare the avg weight in a junction to the average weight out of a junction to find bottlenecks in the traffic system.
